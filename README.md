## LLM Interaction Files
The files for converting a PDF into vectors and storing them in a Pinecone database are in the ```py_upload/``` folder.
The file for actually interacting with the PDF and utilizing OpenAI are in ```py_query_test/```.

## What this project is about
This project will only be a Proof of Concept application. All we want to know is how easy it would be to interact with a PDF that contains over 1000 pages.
Eventually, we will create a different app using concepts we've learned from this one. From testing this application, it seems relatively easy to upload the PDF. The most difficult part will be unlocking all of LangChain's features to really tailor the AI to the Specification Manual.
